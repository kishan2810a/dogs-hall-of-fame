                  K9 Officer Max, a German Shepherd, is a shining example of a
                  working dog dedicated to protecting people. Max is a highly
                  trained police service dog who assists law enforcement in
                  various tasks, including tracking suspects, apprehending
                  criminals, and detecting narcotics. With his keen sense of
                  smell, intelligence, and unwavering loyalty, Max has been
                  instrumental in ensuring public safety and supporting his
                  human counterparts (Torres, 2022). Working dogs play a vital
                  role in guarding and protecting livestock, helping to minimize
                  predation and ensure the well-being of herds. Their natural
                  instincts, intelligence, and loyalty make them indispensable
                  partners for farmers and ranchers (Torres, 2022).

                  As an example, a Great Pyrenees or husky can often be seen
                  guarding sheep or pulling sleds. Today, most of these dogs are
                  companion animals. Although they are generally laid back and
                  easy to care for, they are bred to work, which means they
                  aren't as easy to train as other breeds. Breeds that perform
                  working duties, ranging from sled pulling to guarding, all
                  fall into this group of broadly similar breeds. At present, 31
                  breeds are recognized by the AKC as part of the working group,
                  including huskies, mastiffs, Great Danes, and other popular
                  breeds. There are several breeds in the working group that
                  would make good family pets, but others are quite large and
                  assertive, and so are not suitable for people who have little
                  experience with pets.

                  Dogs protected a boy from freezing weather by covering him.
                  Rescuers captured the dogs. A young boy was believed to have
                  been saved from hypothermia by the dog at the time. Balto, a
                  Siberian Husky, played a vital role in delivering life-saving
                  medicine during the 1925 diphtheria epidemic in Nome, Alaska.
                  Despite harsh weather conditions and treacherous terrain,
                  Balto led a sled dog team through a grueling journey to
                  transport the antitoxin serum to the town, saving countless
                  lives. Balto's courage and determination made him a true hero
                  in the eyes of the community (Anglis, 2021).
